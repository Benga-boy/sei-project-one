Connect 4 Game - I have seven days to complete this project

This is my first project on the SEI course and my aim is to recreate the popular Connect 4 game using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

I have decided to go with a football theme, using the North London derby as my theme.

My first task was creating the grids for the game board. A task which I completed on the first day using a DOM and a for loop.

This is by far a key element to the game and it was a pretty straight forward task to complete. 

I then used the DOM once again to add team selectors for each player to choose a team which also went well.

My first few days have been plain sailing, I have been able to replicate a lot of the things I learned in class and things are looking good.

I watched a few YouTube videos to get inspiration for my game logic, one especially from an ex GA student who made a video of how she went about making her game Link - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBlSiGOFjUY&t=285s

Day three and it is now time to start writing code for my game logic. Where do I start ? ðŸ¤”

I honestly did not have a clue where to start with the game logic so I approached my brother who is also a Developer and he suggested I focused on using classes to build my game in order to get used to object-oriented programming. This still meant nothing to me. 

Day three became day one and I now only have 4 days left before the project is due. 

I had a rough idea of what classes were but not in full detail so I decided to do some reading on Medium and watched some YouTube videos. I also referred back to workshops we had done in class. 

I started my project all over again on the eve of the third day, even with the time constraints. I started off with building my grid now using a 2d array, I was excited as speaking with some of my classmates, I was the only one using a 2d array to build my grid. I knew this will be difficult but I was going to learn a lot. 

Building the grid once again was straight forward using a constructor, I was amazed at how straight forward this was using just the new and Array keywords. I had another plain sailing 24 hours and I was happy to have a grid, a ball that hovers through the grid and to be able to place counters on the the board.

However I struggled to access the grids in order to be able to display the current player. After multiple attempts I figured that my biggest mistake was not console logging , a rookie mistake that will go on to shape the rest of my time on the course and career.

I finally figured out by the fifth day how classes and constructuctors work. I was also happy with being able to place player counters on the board and displaying who the current player is, so that they know it was their turn. 

I just now had to right the game logic, I was already at this stage on the third day but I had no clue where to start and it was still the same situation at this point. I did some googling online and came across an example on Stackoverflow which I used and had to tweak slightly for my game. This worked out just fine and confirmed what I had been told a lot, that the industry is filled with helpful and useful tips because others out there have probably faced the same problems and they share it. 

My game is now working properly and fully functioning by the last day and I am happy with it. All thats left to do is to add some styling to it. 

This has been a tough seven days but I am glad my first real taste of creating an app went the way it did. It was tough and I had a huge mountain to climb but it definitely shaped the way I think about and approach things. One of the key things I learned is the importance of console logging before passing a value to a component and how classes work. This will go on to benefit the future me when we started working with React. 

All in all a very good experience and project, plus I was very happy with the code I wrote.
